# Bootstrap Offcanvas

Super simple, easy to use off-canvas navigation menu for Bootstrap.

It uses Bootstrap classes and markup to create an off-canvas menu that not only looks good. But works perfectly. Example can be found [here](http://iamphill.github.io/Bootstrap-Offcanvas/example.html).

## Installation

Add the stylehseet from the **dist** folder to your HTML document.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="../dist/css/bootstrap.offcanvas.min.css"/>
```

Add the JavaScript from the **dist** folder to your HTML document.

**NOTE: Ensure that jQuery is also present. Otherwise this won't work**

```html
<script src="../dist/js/bootstrap.offcanvas.js"></script>
```

In the HTML itself there needs to a button or something to trigger the menu.
**NOTE: It can be ANY HTML element**

The below example is the exact same markup as from the Bootstrap docs. The only differences are the `data-toggle`, `data-target` attributes and `offcanvas-toggle` class.

```html
<button type="button" class="navbar-toggle offcanvas-toggle" data-toggle="offcanvas" data-target="#js-bootstrap-offcanvas">
    <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
</button>
```

Finally, the nav HTML should be as follows. The only things needed are:

- The class `navbar-offcanvas`
- The selector that is specified in the `data-target` of the toggle. Example below uses an ID.
**NOTE: This can also be any element as long as the classes and attributes are correct**

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-offcanvas" role="navigation" id="js-bootstrap-offcanvas">
    ...
</nav>
```

You can change the position of the off-canvas nav by adding the following class

```
navbar-offcanvas-right
```

Dropdown menus are support, again using the Bootstrap standard markup.

The only difference is that it doesn't need the data-toggle. But this could be left in if you require it to be present.

```html
<li class="dropdown">
    <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle">Dropdown <span class="caret"></span></a>
    <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu">
        <li><a href="#">Action</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Another action</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Something else here</a></li>
        <li class="divider"></li>
        <li><a href="#">Separated link</a></li>
        <li class="divider"></li>
        <li><a href="#">One more separated link</a></li>
    </ul>
</li>
```

### Touch events

It is possible to add touch events to swipe the menu in and out by simply adding the following class to the navigation HTML element.

```
navbar-offcanvas-touch
```

**NOTE**
This will only add to the first found off-canvas menu for now. At some point in the future I might make it be able to handle more than element.
However, just for now it will take the first off-canvas menu with the class `navbar-offcanvas-touch` and presume this should have touch events.

iOS7+ does have a gesture to swipe the page back and forward, and a threshold has been put in. This might not be perfect, and might need tweaking.

## Events

There are four different events that are triggered on the nav element. These follow the same syntax as the Official Bootstrap JS plugins.

| Event Type               | Description                                 |
| -------------     |:-------------:                        |
| show.bs.offcanvas     | Fire before the offcanvas menu is shown   |
| shown.bs.offcanvas    | Fire after the offcanvas menu is shown    |
| hide.bs.offcanvas      | Fire before the offcanvas menu is hidden  |
| hidden.bs.offcanvas    | Fire after the offcanvas menu is hidden   |


## Running example

Run the below commands to install all dependencies and then just open the index.html file in example/

```
npm install
bower install
```

## Customizing

Its possible to customize to your needs by using SASS.

Want to include with your Bootstrap SASS? Copy across the files in src/sass.

The SASS files use a few variables. These are explained below.

```sass
$offcanvas-width: 250px !default; // The width of the offcanvas menu
$offcanvas-animation-time: 0.15s !default; // Transition time to pull/hide menu
$offcanvas-toggle-background: #f8f8f8 !default; // Background colour for toggle
$offcanvas-toggle-bars-color: #000 !default; // Colour for icon bars in toggle
```

There is one media query and this uses the Bootstrap `$screen-sm` variable. If this isn't present, then the width of `768px` is used for the breakpoint.
